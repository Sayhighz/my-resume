                <p>
                    Since I was a young child, my interest in
                    programming
                    and computer systems has never waned. It all began
                    during my elementary school years when my
                    grandfather
                    bought a computer for my older sister to use for her
                    work. This opened the door for me to have regular
                    access
                    to computers, which has continued to this day.

                    My passion for programming has remained constant
                    throughout. It was during my middle school years
                    that I
                    decided to seriously delve into the world of coding.
                    I
                    started by enrolling in online courses to grasp the
                    fundamentals of programming through self-study. I
                    gained
                    a profound understanding of the basics and
                    principles of
                    programming, which I now consider second nature.

                    Upon completing my secondary education, I made the
                    decision to pursue higher education at Sripatum
                    University. I chose to enter the Faculty of
                    Information
                    Technology, majoring in Computer Science and
                    Software
                    Development Innovation. This marks a significant
                    step
                    forward in honing my professional programming skills
                    for
                    the future.

                    It has the capability to retrieve player data from Ark:

                    in Discord. Additionally, it can provide additional
